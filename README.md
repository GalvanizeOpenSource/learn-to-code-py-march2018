# Python Learn to Code

## Galvanize Boulder Campus. March 9, 2018.

Welcome to Gavanize in Boulder! And thank you for coming to our event.

Tonight, we will do some basic data analysis of the measurements of irises. One day, a long time ago, some dedicated guy took measurements of a bunch of iris petals and sepals, and classifid the irises into their varieties based on those measurements. We will train the computer to detect those different varieties. See [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set). By doing this you will see how to use some important technologies in the Python data analysis ecosystem.

We will use the following tools:

+ Python 3: This is a programming language that underlies an enormous data science technology ecosystem. In addition to data science, Python can bse used for many other programming tasks. 

+ Jupyter: This enables us to see our Python code alongside data and visualization charts.

+ Pandas: This is how we will work with our table of article data. Essentially, it is like a spreadsheet you use with Python code, rather than pointing and clicking with a mouse.

+ Matplotlib: This makes data visualizations.
